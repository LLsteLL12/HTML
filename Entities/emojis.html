        A diacritical mark is used on characters to show accents
        for example.

        Guard in Polish would be Stranz&#768;ik.
        <p>
         Using the examplary word "guard" you would add the accent by coding "Stranz& #768 ;ik". 
         Showing the code needed to be after the accented character.
