<!--Creating animations and Keyframes.-->

    <h2>Creating Animations and Keyframes.</h2>
    
    <p>
        An animation brings life to our page to life by giving gradual change too an element from one style to another.
        We can change as many CSS properties you want, as frquently as we woukd like.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To use CSS animation, we must first specify some keyframes for the animation using CSS.
        Keyframes hold what styles the elements will have at certain times and for durations of our choosing.
    </p>
    
    <br><br>
    
    <p>
    We would code it using CSS as follows :-
    <br>
    @keyframes simple {
    <br>from{
    <br>
        background-color: blue; }
    <br>
    to {
        background-color:purple; }
    <br> }
    
    button:hover {
    <br> 
        color: white;
    <br>
        background-color: blue;
    <br>
    <br>
        animation-name: simple; <!-- connects the keyframe by it's name-->
    <br>animation-duration: 4s; }
    
    </p>

    <p>
        The above code would give us the affect on the button below.
    </p>
    <br>
    
<button> Blue-Purple in 4s</button>

<br><br><br>

<div id="about">

</div>


<p> -------------------ISSUES WITH THE TRANSITIONING PICTURE ANIMATIONS -------------
</p>

<br><br><br><br>

<h2> 
    "Carousel" 
</h2>

<p> 
    When we mention carousel, it means a series of transitioning actions such as pictures. These would usually evolve through stages of an animation which are generally staged in percentages.
<br>
So it would look like this:-
<br>
@keyframes carousel {
<br>
0%    {background-image: url ('1st picture')
 }
<br>
 25%   {background-image: url ('2nd picture')
}
<br>
50%   {background-image: url ('3rd picture')
}
<br>
75%   {background-image: url ('4th picture')
}
<br>
100%   {background-image: url ('5th picture') 
<br>
}
<br><br>

#carousel {
<br> width:100px;
<br> height:200px;
<br> animation: carousel 50s infinite;
<br> }
</p>

<div id="carousel">
    
</div>


<h2> Cubic Beziers</h2>
<p>
    Cubic beziers are the rate of which we can determine the speed transitions take place.
    They are generally equally spaced out which would be known as a "Linear cubic bezier". We can change the rates to suit our preferations.
    <br>
    The function we would use is the "animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier (.0,.0,.0,.0,)"
    <br>
    See <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com"> cubic bezier</a> to play around with the different modes.
</p>


<h2> Transitions</h2>
<p>
    Starting with the "transition" property, we would need to specify 2 things. 
    1) The CSS property we would like to be effected.
    2) The duration of the effect. This would have to have a value greater than 0.
</p>

<p> 
    With a transition effect applied, not only can we alter the colour features of an object, we can change many more properties along with it.
    For instance:- 
    <br> 
    If we were to use the code
    <br><br>
    .btn{
<br>        width: 100px;
<br>        height:25px;
<br>        background: green;
<br>        transition: background-color 3s, width 3s;
<br>    }
<br><br>
<br>    .btn:hover{
<br>        width:200px;
<br>        height:75px;
<br>        background: aqua;
<br>    }
</p>

<p> 
    In format with a form, you can see how it can make a difference to the user. Thus keeping them interacting with the page.
</p>


<label for="first"> First Name: </label>
<input type="text" id="first" name="first" placeholder="First Name or Title">
<br>
<label for="last"> Last Name: </label>
<input type="text" id="Last" name="last" placeholder="Last Name" required>
<br> 
<label for="Email"> Email Address: </label>
<input type="email" id="Email" name="email" placeholder="Email Address">
<br> 
<label for="date"> Enter Your Birthday </label>
<input type="date" id="birthday" name="birthday" placeholder="DD/MM/YYYY">
<br> 
<label for="phone"> Phone Number </label>
<input type="number" id="number" name="number" placeholder="Contact Number">
<br>
<input type="reset" value="Reset Form">
<br>
<input class="btn" type="submit" id="submit" value="Submit Form">

<p>
    We could also use transitions in terms of enlarging text to ensure peoper choice on a page. 
    By ahving enlarged text as the user hovers this can ensure that the link they are choosing is the desired one.
</p>

<h2>Transform</h2>

<p>
    To elevate the life that we bring to our page we can even animate or "transform" items on our page.
    <br>
    Using the "Transform" property we can do many things such as:-


<br>    - Rotate = Rotate an item on the axis (X or Y).
This would look like:-
<br><br>

<br><br><br>    - Translate = This would give a reflection if you will of the item dependent on the values given for the axis.

<br><br>
<img src="/Images/strawberry jam.jpg" class="strawberry">
<br><br><br><br>





<br>    - Skew = Alters the viewing angle of an item. This usually only requires one value, either X (horizontal) or Y (vertical). 
This reflects using positive and negative values in degrees.
<br><br><br>

<img src="/Images/orange.jpeg" class="orange">

<br><br><br>  - Scale = The viewing size of an item that can increase or decrease dependent on the values used in the funtion. 
Positive values would increase the sizing and negative values would decrease the scaling.
