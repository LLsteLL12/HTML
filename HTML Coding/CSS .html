    <h4> Intoduction to CSS </h4>
    
    <p> To begin. we link the HTML files with CSS using the following code inside the "head" tag :- 
        < link rel="stylesheet" href="/CSS coding/CSS Day2.css" </p>
    
    <h2> The Relationships between tags and elements</h2>
    
    <p>
        Quick break down of relationships
        <br>
        <br>< body> = parent to < header> (< header is considere a child>) grand parent too < h1>, < div>, < img src> but great grandparent too < p>
        <br> < header> = child but also has children - < h1>, < p> , < img src> (otherwise known as siblings)
        <br> Sibllings = grandchildren to < body>
        <br><br>
        <br> < body> is the parent
        <br>< header> child of < body>
        <br>< Img src> < h1> < div> are grandchildren of < body> but children of < header>
        <br>< p> is the great grandchild of < body>
        <br>
            For example 
            <br>< section> <!- This section is a child of the body tag->
            <br>   < nav> <!- This section is a grandchild of the body tag ->
            <br>    < a href="">< /a> <!- This section is a great grandchild of the body tag ->
            <br>    < a href="">< /a>
            <br>    < a href="">< /a>
            <br>< /nav>
            <br>< /section>
    </p>
    
    <br>
        <h2> Combinator Selectors </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
        Combinator Selectors use a preset code of rulings to be able to select elements based on a specific relationship between them.
        </p>
        <p>
        Decendent selector (space) ELEMENT ELEMENT e.g div p { styleCode }
        <br>div p{         --- Any paragraph that is a decendent of a div will give the following ---
        <br>font-weight: 300;
        <br> color : pink;
        }
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>    
        Child selector (>) ELEMENT > ELEMENT {} e.g div>p{styleCode} p is a child of div 
        <br>div>p{         --- Any paragraph that is a CHILD decendent of a div will give the following ---
        <br>font-weight: 300;
        <br> color : pink;
        }
        </p>
        <p>
        <br>
        Adjacent sibling selector (+) next to the target ELEMENT + ELEMENT{}
        <br>div+p{         --- Anything that is a immediatley above or below (adjacent) the div but on the same level will give the following ---
        <br>font-weight: 300;
        <br>color : pink;
        }
        <br>
        For example 
        <br>< div class ="">
        <br>< p> word < /p> ----IMPACTED BY SELECTOR
        <br>< div class="">
        <br>  < img src="/file/filename" alt="alternative">
        <br></ div>
        <br>< p> word < /p> ----ALSO IMPACTED BY SELECTOR AS IT IS ADJACENT
        <br>< div class=""> ---- NOT AFFECTED AS IT IS THE SAME LEVEL AS INITIAL DIV
        <br>     < img src="/file/filename" alt="alternative">
        <br>     </ div>
        <br>
        </p>
       <p>
            General sibling selector (~) anything on the sibling ELEMENT ~ ELEMENT{}
        <br>
        div~p{         --- Anything that is a general sibling after the div will give the following ---
            <br> font-weight: 300;
            <br> color : pink;
        }
        <br>
        For example 
        <br>< div class ="">
        <br>< p> word < /p> 
        <br>< div class="">
        <br>    < img src="/file/filename" alt="alternative">
        <br>< /div>
        <br>< div class=""> 
        <br>     < img src="/file/filename" alt="alternative">
        <br>     < /div>
        <br>     < p> word < /p> ----IMPACTED BY GENERAL SELECTOR
        <br>     < p> word < /p>  ----IMPACTED BY GENERAL SELECTOR
        <br>     < p> word < /p>  ----IMPACTED BY GENERAL SELECTOR
        <br>
        Sibling = same level of power in the code hierarchy.
    </p>
        
        <p><br>
        Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        <br>
        Style an element for when the user hovers the mouse over. -- Typically used with forms
        Style visited and unvisited links differently -- Typically used with hyperlinks
        Style an element when it gets focus
        <br>
        .btn,
        <br>button {
        <br>    background-color: red;
        <br>    color:pink;
        }
        <br>
        .btn:hover,
        <br>input:hover,
        <br>button:hover {
        <br>    background-color: pink;
        <br>    color:red;
        
        <br>a:link {
        <br>        color: lightblue;   }
        }
        <br>

    <!-- CSS  (Fonts)-->
    <div>
    <h2> CSS Coding Fonts and Icons </h2>
    <p> CSS style sheets are a set of codes written to use as a way of styling a page with HTML coding on it. This would be considered a ruleset. Using these rulesets we can give our webpages a bit of personality by simply adding the CSS code into the "head" tag of the HTML sheet.
        When writing in CSS format we always start with the property which is generally in a blue colour. After the colon, would be the value the property that will be take on by the item.
       <br> For eample :-
    <br>If in CSS code we had :
    <br>"div {
        <br>font-weight:700;
        <br>color:cornflowerblue;
        <br>font-size:18px
        <br>}"
        <br> This would change any text contained in "div" tags within a HTML document to be bold (font-weight: 700;)
     have the text chnaged to cornflowerblue (color:cornflowerblue;) and have a font size of 18 pixels (font-size:18px). This depends on the rules explained previously on the specificity and hierarchy of the "id" (#"idName") and "class" (."ClassName") attributes. </p>
     <br>
     <h6> Inline, internal and external CSS </h6>
     <br>
    <p> Internal = In HTML document using "style" e.g style="color: blue, font-fsmily:Arial;"
    Internal = CSS written inside a CSS stylesheet in the coding software used by the user.
    
    External = CSS imported by an external source. 
    For example in this case we will be using external CSS from Googlefonts.com and fontawesome.com.
    </p>
    
    <p>  Starting our journey with CSS we will be looking at how to add or chnage fonts using websites <a href="https://www.googlefonts.com"> Google fonts </a> and <a href="https://fontawesome.com"> Font Awesome</a>
    </p><br>
    <h5> Google fonts</h5>
    <p>
    Using Google fonts we would load up the webpage. Select our fonts and then, just like the imported video method. We would use the "head" tags in the boilercode to insert the embedded code we have copied from google fonts. 
    It would look as follows:-
    </p> 
    
    
    <p>
    < head>
    <br>
            < meta charset="UTF-8">
        <br> < meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <br> < meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <br>
        < link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <br> < link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <br> < link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Alkatra&family=Crimson+Text&family=Josefin+Sans&family=Roboto:wght@500&display=swap" 
    rel="stylesheet">
        <br> < title>Document< /title>
    <br> < /head>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        To link the HTML file code with the CSS file code we would use the following line:-
    "< link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> "
    </p>
    
    <p>
        < link rel="stylesheet" href="/CSS coding/CSS 1 STYLES.css"> - This uses a file path to locate where the CSS code is to shortcut the styling.
        <br> 
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/CSS coding/CSS 1 STYLES.css">
    This will change which tags and elements have the coding included to that relayed in course with the CSS stylesheet.
    For this, I have created the element "h4" and I have styled it - <h4>Like this.</h4> - 
    </p>
    
    <p> The reason we put the CSS code link into the "head" element is because on tne CSS codesheet, the coding will refer to different elements in HTML and will automatically occur once written.</p>
    
    <br> 
    
    <h3> Font Awesome</h3>
    
    <p> Font awesome is similar to Google fonts however, instead of using fonts. Font Awesome uses icons instead. Many of which are used in todays technology. There are the typical icons and even social media icons too making it a really useful site too use.</p>
    
    <p> Font Awesome can be useful for enforcing a theme of a page with icons. Saving space, coding time and keeping the user directly interacting with the interface.</p>
    
    <p> To use Font Awesome we would simply sign up for the free kit code and follow the instructions to allow cross communication between the Html file and the server. This is as simple as copying and pasting the unique code into the "head" tag of our HTML page.
        <br> From there, we would select an icon from Font Awesome and then  add it into our code. 
        For example on a "Nav Bar" you might want to use icons instead of words or alongside them so :- 
    < nav class="nav1">
    < a href="#home"> Home < i class="fa-solid fa-house"> < /i> < /a>
    < /nav>
    <br> 
    With this line we have the "class="nav1"" acting for the set code from CSS 
    We have the href "#home" for a specific CSS programme.
    Finally we have the "< i class="fa-solid fa-house"> < /i>". Which is the code imported from Font Awesomes page to represent the "Home" icon.
    <i class="fa-solid fa-house"> </i> 
    
    </p>
    </div>
    
    <!--Chrome developer tools-->
    <blockquote>
    <h3> Chrome developer tools.</h3>
    
    <p> To get to Chrome developer tools: click the elipsis in the browser and then scroll down too "More tools". From here go too "developer tools". This will open a window where you can then see the elements of the current webpage you're on. Using this you can click on a piece of a page and see the HTML coding that makes it part of the webpage including any other coding languages that work in conjunction like CSS.</p>
    
    <p> This is a great way to edit and test things in the Chrome Developer tools that you can potentially use in your own coding.</p>

    <!-- CSS Day 2 (Backgrounds and Bodys)-->
    <div>
    <h3> Background and Borders with CSS </h3>
    
    <p> 
    Pages are initialised with a basic white background that we can edit or customise to give our page more of a personality.
        Backgrouynnds and borders allow us to fill our page with colour, clipped or resized imagery and many more ways.
    These styles can also decorate borders with lines, images, rounded or squared.
    </p>
    
    <p> 
    If we were to use the tag "< "element", id name or class >  {
     <br>   background: <!-- This is the shorthand command that can deal with the basic styling -->
    <br>SHORTHAND 
    <br>body { 
    <br>background: url('File path to selected image')  no-repeat center 100px;
    <br>}
    <br>#background-vid{
        <br>position: fixed;
        <br>z-index:-1;
        <br>width:100px;
        <br>height:100%;
    <br>}
    <br> When we load our page we would have an image that we have inserted into the file path("background:url('FilePath')"),with the repeater disabled ("no-repeat") placed into the cemter of the page ("center") with a size of 100 pixels (100px).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        If an image has a transparent background then we could add a colour to it ourselves by using the following code:- 
        <br>

    </p>
    
    
    </div>
    
</body>
</html>
